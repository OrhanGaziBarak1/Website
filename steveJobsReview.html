                Based on more than forty interviews with Jobs conducted over two years - as well as 
                interviews with more than a hundred family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, 
                and colleagues - Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life 
                and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection 
                and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, 
                music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing.

                At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, and when societies 
                around the world are trying to build digital-age economies, Jobs stands as the ultimate 
                icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value 
                in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company 
                where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering.

                <br>
                Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written nor 
                even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged 
                the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about 
                the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an 
                unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion 
                for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted.
                <br>
                <br>
                Driven by demons, Jobs could drive those around him to fury and despair. But his personality 
                and products were interrelated, just as Appleâ€™s hardware and software tended to be, as if part 
                of an integrated system. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about 
                innovation, character, leadership, and values.
